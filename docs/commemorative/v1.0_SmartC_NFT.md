## Instructions

## User commands
* Bid: Use to make an offer at some item. If the value is greater than the item price, the user will buy the item. Any excess value will be refunded. If the amout is less than price, the contract will hold the balance and add one offer at that item. Each item can have at most 3 offers. If this limit is reached, the contract will not accept bids less then the lower active offer. If the offer is greater than the minimum, the contract will revoke the minimum offer and add this new offer at that place. If the same user send a second offer, it will replace the old order and the previous order balance is refunded. It is possible to make offers on items that are not on sale (hold).
* Revoke: At any time the user can revoke the offer and get the balance back.

### Owner commands
* Sell: used to change the item price, must be greater than zero. If there are active bids and the price is lower the highest bid, the item will be sold for the highest bid amount
* Hold: Items on hold are not on sale, but they still can receive bids.
* Transfer: select the user to transfer the item to. In order to pay the fees, the recipient must have an active bid in the item and the bid amount must be higher than the transfer fee (the excess value will be refunded). This also avoids transfering items to wrong accounts or burning them.
* Stop: By default, any new offer received at some item will generate a notification to owner. To stop these notifications, use this command. Notifications will be turned on again if owner send another command (sell, hold or transfer). This command is valid for one item and there is no command to stop all items if user is owner of many items.

### Fees
For each sale it is deducted from price 5% fee.
The last sale price is stored, so transfers need to pay 5% of last sale.
The fee is added to the balance to be distributed as dividend.

### Dividends
When the dividends balance is greater than 17 Signa, the contract will proceed the distribution to current owners.
The unspent gas collected from commands will also be added to dividends.
There is a special command allowing contract to receive dividends from another account.
Each item is considered one share. 

### Limitations
User can send many messages at same block, all of them will be processed.
