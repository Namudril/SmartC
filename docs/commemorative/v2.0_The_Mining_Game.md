# The Mining Game
Did you ever though about a token that is mined by smart contract? And proof-of-donation?

## How it works
The system consists in two types of smart contracts: TMGMiner and TMGPicker. Check the concepts:

### Miner
This smart contract is deployed by users. After add balance to the contract it will start to send deadlines to the main Picker contract. By default it will start by mining with the least amount possible (0.32 Signa per hour or 7.6 Signa per day). The creator can change the mining intensity. Send at least 0.5 Signa and add a plain message with the new value. Ex: `1.344`. The contract will continue the loop until there is no more balance. At any time creator can send some amount of Signa to top up the balance and the mining intesity will continue the same. To stop the contract and receive the remaining balance, send a transaction with amount over 0.5 and the plain text `stop`. In less than one hour the contract will be activated again and the balance will be sent back.

### Picker
Smart contract deployed by deleterium, will centralize all received deadlines, pick the best, forge one token and send directly to the creator of that Miner. The picker will inspect the contract that send the deadline to ensure it is a valid Miner contract, to avoid deadline tampering. When a new deadline is submited after 15 or more blocks from previous forging, the contract will mint one token and transfer to the creator of the contract that sent the best deadline. This process will cause balance to build up in the contract and once a day it will be distributed to the holders of TMG asset, if the balance is greater than 250 Signa.

### Deadlines
The miner contract will send a transaction to the picker. This transaction has an ID that can not be controlled by the creators. It depends on the time that the block was forged, so it is suposed to be random (note 1). To calculate the deadline, the Picker will:
1. Get the transaction ID value and divide by two. This is the base deadline. Division is needed to avoid negative values internally.
2. Get the transaction amount (mining intensity) and divide by the minimum amount (0.32 Signa). This factor (always greater or equal one) is called mining factor.
3. The final deadline is the base deadline divided by the mining factor. So the greater the mining factor, lower the deadline.
In this way, users can adjust the mining intensity to increase change to win a block, and with bigger overall mining intensity, more Signa will be distributed to TMG token holders.

### Signa distribution
Once per day the Picker will check the accumulated balance in the contract. If this amount is greater than 250 Signa, 98% of it will be distributed to holders that have at least 1.0 TMG available in account (not on sell orders!). There is also a creator fee of 2%, that will be forwarded to SmartC NFT contract and distributed to the holders of SmartC Keywords.

### Burned fees
When the contracts are running at the least mining intensity, almost all Signa will be consumed by contract execution. This is the way the smart contracts work, because each machine code instructions costs 0.001 Signa. With more players with bigger mining intensity, more balance will accumulate in the Picker contract to be distributed.

## The web site
Check https://tmg.notallmine.net/ for a beautful website to check network information, link your account and control your miner contract.

## Notes:
1. In theory the transaction ID from a smart contract can be manipulated during an attack from a bad actor with more than 50% Signum mining power. This is unlikely and, if done, the entire blockchain will be compromised. For this game purpose this situation is negligible.
