# Built-in functions
Since version 2.0 some built-in functions were added.

## mdv
* Prototype:
`long mdv(long m1, long m2, long div);`
* Description:
Computes the value of `m1` multiplied by `m2` with 128-bit precision (no overflow) and then divides this result by `div`.
The calculation is returned as value.
* Notes:
  1) This instruction will be used in optimizations, even if not explicit declared. Use this form to ensure the instruction, or check generated assembly code if in doubt.

## pow
* Prototype:
`long pow(long base, long expBy1e8);`
* Description:
Computes the value of `base` to the power of `expBy1e8`, where expBy1e8 is used as fixed point representation with 8 decimals (like the values in Signa). The result is returned as long value, decimals are truncated.
* Examples:
  * sqrt(49) = 7 :: `val = pow(49, 5000_0000);`
  * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 5^4 = 625 :: `val = pow(5, 4_0000_0000);`
  * sqrt(48) = 6 :: `val = pow(48, 5000_0000);`
* Notes
  1) pow will return zero if the result is matematically undefined;
  2) pow will return zero if base is negative;
  3) pow will return zero if result is greater than 9223372036854775807 (max positive long).

## powf
* Prototype:
`long pow(long base, fixed exp);`
* Description:
Same as `pow` but using fixed point number for the exponent.
* Examples:
  * sqrt(49) = 7 :: `val = powf(49, 0.5);`
  * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 5^4 = 625 :: `val = pow(5, 4.0);`
  * sqrt(48) = 6 :: `val = pow(48, .5);`
* Notes
  1) pow will return zero if the result is matematically undefined;
  2) pow will return zero if base is negative;
  3) pow will return zero if result is greater than 9223372036854775807 (max positive long).

## memcopy
* Prototype:
`void memcopy(void * destination, void * source);`
* Description:
Copies the binary value from source to destination. Handyful to copy variables content without type casting modifying them.
* Example:
  * `fixed f; long l; memcopy(&f, &l);` This will copy the binary data from variable `l` to `f` without transformations. If l is 50, then f will be 0.00000050.
